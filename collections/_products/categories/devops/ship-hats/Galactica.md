Description=At Meta we believe the way to advance AI research is through an open transparent and reproducible process. We also believe that progress is best served by inviting a wide and diverse community to participate and provide feedback. The Galactica research paper model code and corresponding demo are intended for the research community and are not being used in production. At launch we outlined the limitations that come with large language models such as Galactica including the potential for it to generate inaccurate and unreliable output even though Galactica was trained on high-quality scientific and academic data. We believe it is critical for the public to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these language models in an open and transparent way. We also believe this is the best way to get feedback on these systems and learn how to mitigate the weaknesses. However given the propensity of large language models such as Galactica to generate text that may appear authentic but is inaccurate and because it has moved beyond the research community we chose to remove the demo from public availability.
Pros=Open transparent and reproducible process Wide and diverse community to participate Outlined limitations that come with language models.
Cons=Potential to generate inaccurate and unreliable output Might generate text that may appear authentic but inaccurate.
