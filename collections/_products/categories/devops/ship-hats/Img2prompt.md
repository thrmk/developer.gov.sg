Description=Provides approximate text prompts that can be used with stable diffusion to re-create similar looking versions of the image/painting. Try it by copying the text prompts to stable diffusion! A slightly adapted version of the CLIP Interrogator notebook by @pharmapsychotic. If this notebook is helpful to you please consider buying @pharmapsychotic a coffee via ko-fi or following @AIMindFlow and @pharmapsychotic on twitter for more cool Ai stuff. The CLIP Interrogator uses the OpenAI CLIP models to test a given image against a variety of artists mediums and styles to study how the different models see the content of the image. It also combines the results with BLIP caption to suggest a text prompt to create more images similar to what was given.
Pros=Run time and cost Predictions run on Nvidia T4 GPU hardware. Predictions typically complete within 22 seconds.
