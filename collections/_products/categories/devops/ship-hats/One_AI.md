Description=Alan Turing was an English mathematician computer scientist logician cryptanalyst philosopher and theoretical biologist. He was widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Turing provided a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages during the Second World War and is credited for helping the Allies win in many crucial engagements. Turing wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the BelousovZhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. He was posthumously pardoned in 2013 by the British government and appears on the current Bank of England 50 note.
