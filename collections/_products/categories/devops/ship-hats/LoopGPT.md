Description=LoopGPT is an experiment with OpenAIs GPT-3.5 Turbo model. On this webpage you can trigger a conversation between two AI chatbots John and Jane. You have to set the context before starting the chat and then send the first message and the rest of the conversation is generated by the AI. You also need to set a timer for the chat. A page reload or the Stop Button can act as a kill switch and you can create a JSON file of the conversation history.
Pros=Relatively easy to use Good security with API Key stored locally Ability to export conversation history as a JSON file
Cons=Can be slow and time consuming May get stuck in an endless loop Can eat up OpenAI credits if not monitored
Pricing=Experiment Free of Cost
