Description=Toronto AI Lab GET3D is a Generative Model of High Quality 3D Textured Shapes Learned from Images. The model utilizes a rasterization-based differentiable renderer to obtain RGB images and silhouettes and uses two 2D discriminators to classify whether the inputs are real or fake. The end-to-end model is able to generate diverse shapes with high-quality geometry and texture as well as text-guided shape generation and unsupervised material generation. GET3D bridges recent successes in differentiable surface modeling differentiable rendering and 2D Generative Adversarial Networks.
Pros=Generates diverse shapes with high-quality geometry and texture text-guided shape generation and unsupervised material generation.
