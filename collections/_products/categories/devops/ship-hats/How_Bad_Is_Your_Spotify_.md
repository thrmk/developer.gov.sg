Description=How Bad Is Your Streaming Music? Our sophisticated A.I. judges your awful taste in music. This is a satirical project and does not use real artificial intelligence but a faux pretentious music-loving AI. The code creates a custom blend of jokes from our database paired with the insights found in the artist album genre and track data from your Spotify or Apple Music. This project does not save any Spotify or Apple Music data. When you log-in with Spotify or Apple account it creates a special one-time code to read your top songs and tracks as well as recent playlists. That access goes away until you come back.
Pros=This project does not save any Spotify or Apple Music data and access goes away until you come back.
Cons=Satirical project and does not use real artificial intelligence.
Pricing=Free
Company Address=The Pudding is a digital publication that explains ideas debated in culture with visual essays.
