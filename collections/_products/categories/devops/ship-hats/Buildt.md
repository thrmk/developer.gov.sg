Description=Engineers at companies like Stripe and Airbnb have to work with million-line codebases; our LLM-powered tool makes this simple. Current code search tools rely only on string matches and wont allow you to find what you want by describing the function vaguely. By mapping your codebase with our fine tuned LLM that we trained with proprietary synthetic data sets our AI has a better than human understanding of any codebase. So with Buildt you can ask questions about your own project as if an expert was next to you!
