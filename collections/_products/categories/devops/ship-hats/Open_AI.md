Description=DALLE is a 12-billion parameter version of GPT-3 trained to generate images from text descriptions using a dataset of text image pairs. Weve found that it has a diverse set of capabilities including creating anthropomorphized versions of animals and objects combining unrelated concepts in plausible ways rendering text and applying transformations to existing images. DALLE can create plausible images for a great variety of sentences that explore the compositional structure of language and that can modify several of an objects attributes as well as the number of times that it appears.
Pros=Generating realistic images from text descriptions Modifying several attributes of an object Rendering text
Cons=Lower success rate for generating images for unusual shapes like pentagon
