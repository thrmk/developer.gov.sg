Description=Vectara is LLM-powered search-as-a-service. The platform provides a complete ML search pipeline from extraction and indexing to retrieval re-ranking and calibration. Every element of the platform is API-addressable. Developers can embed the most advanced NLP models for app and site search in minutes. Vectara automatically extracts text from PDF and Office to JSON HTML XML CommonMark and many more. It encodes at scale with cutting edge zero-shot models using deep neural networks optimized for language understanding segments data into any number of indexes storing vector encodings optimized for low latency and high recall and retrieves candidate results from millions of documents using cutting-edge zero-shot neural network models. It also reranks to increase precision of retrieved results with cross-attentional neural networks to merge and reorder results and calibrate with zeroing in on the true likelihoods that the retrieved response represents a probable answer to the query.
